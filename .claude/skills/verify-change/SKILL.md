## The one gate

`bin/check` is the gate. CI runs it and the pre-commit hook runs it, so a change that
passes it locally passes everywhere.

| Step | Command | What it is |
|------|---------|------------|
| install | `bin/setup` | bundle install |
| run | `bin/dev` | bundle exec rake build_local |
| prove | `bin/check` | bundle exec rake build_local && bundle exec rspec spec/seven_zip_ruby_spec.rb |

## Rules

- Run every command from the repo root — the scripts `cd` there themselves.
- `bin/check` red is not a pull request. Fix the cause, never silence the gate.

## Exit codes `bin/check` must use

A coding box runs this gate before it commits, and it has to tell a FAILING change
from a gate it could not run — otherwise correct work is thrown away as if it were
red. Exit 1 cannot carry that difference, so one code is reserved:

| Exit | Means | What the platform does |
|------|-------|------------------------|
| 0 | the change passes | commit it |
| 75 | a resource the gate NEEDS is unreachable (a database, a service, a credential) — it refused to grade | refuse the commit, and blame the environment, never the change |
| any other non-zero | the gate ran and the change is red | refuse the commit, and blame the change |

- Guard preconditions FIRST and `exit 75` when one is unmet. `exit 1` there tells the
  platform your change is broken when it is your environment that is.
- Changed a dependency? Re-run `bin/setup` before `bin/check`, or you are proving a stale tree.
- Add the test that fails first, then the fix — a green run that never went red proves nothing.
